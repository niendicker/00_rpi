The modbusTcpMaster Service will run on the target system (arm) collecting information from all configured devices. An example configuration can be found in the file < dbms/00_rpi/gc600.conf >. The modbus registers map of each modbus device must follow the file model < dbms/00_rpi/gc600.mbr >.

Multiple processes can be configured with one or more devices.
